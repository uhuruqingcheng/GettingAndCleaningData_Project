The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

# A. Origin dataset information
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

The dataset includes the following files:

> * *README.txt*
> * *features_info.txt* : Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
> * *features.txt* : List of all features.
> * *activity_labels.txt* : Links the class labels with their activity name.
> * *train/X_train.txt* : Training set.
> * *train/y_train.txt* : Training labels.
> * *test/X_test.txt* : Test set.
> * *test/y_test.txt* : Test labels.


# B. Data processing by this script
## B1.  Read files  
> * Read *activity_labels.txt* to data frame *activities*
> * Read *features.txt* to data frame *features*
> * Read *X_train.txt* to data frame *X_train*
> * Read *X_test.txt* to data frame *X_test*
> * Read *y_train.txt* to data frame *y_train*
> * Read *y_test.txt* to data frame *y_test*
> * Read *subject_train.txt* to data frame *subject_train*
> * Read *subject_test.txt* to data frame *subject_test*

## B2. Merges and labels data set
Using **cbind()** function, we first combine  *subject_train* , *y_train* and *X_train* by columns, which has also done for test data. Then we Using **rbind()** function combine training data and test data in one data frame named *Merges* which contains all records.

Then we names the column in *Merges* by using descriptive variable names in *features*. The first two  columns were named by "subject" and "activity".

At last,  we use descriptive activity names in *activities* to name the activities in the data set *Merges*.

## B3. Extracts needed features
Since only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement are needed. we use  **grep()** function on the features vector to look for **mean()** and **std()** strings and return a *tidy_data* which has 68 columns.

## B4. Create the final tidy data
we create a independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, with using **melt()** and **dcast()** function. 

What we get is the average value for each couple {subject, activity} of the 66 selected features (mean and standard deviation for each measurement).

Having 30 subjects, 6 activites and 66 features, we finally get a 180 x 68 tidy data set.

Then by using **write.table()** function, we create a text file containing this new tidy data set, which is the final *tidy_data.txt* .

## B5. variables in the final tidy data
